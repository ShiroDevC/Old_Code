Module for a individualized spatial model to be used in the CCOBRA Framework.
Each individualized model uses one or more individualizations implemented in the
modified spatial model.
This Module uses the 'verbal memory' individualization.

    Model to test the individualization, which is responsible for the verbal memory usage.
    If the individualization is active, the model will answer to the given problem by using
    an implementation of the verbal memory.
    The individualization can be activated in the adapt function. The individualization
    can be activated and deactivated dynamically. The rating and prior values need
    to be over a specified threshold, to activate the individualization.

        After all individualzations are rated, they will be activaed or deactivated

        All priors are normed like this, because they represent a percentual value.
