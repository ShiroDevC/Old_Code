    Model to test the categorization approach. This model will search for differences
    between certain categories of problems. If there is a big difference between
    the results of two categories, the model will activate certain parameters for
    the spatial model. In some cases, the problem will be modified before it will
    be processed by the spatial model, to simulate individualizations.
    Categories:
        problem type3: problem start with A/B or  C/D; R/L as the task relation..
        problem type2: task relation == problem relation/task relation != problem relation.
        problem type1: problem start with A/B or C/D.
