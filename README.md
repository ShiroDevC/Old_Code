This repository contains code from my time as a student including my Bachelor Thesis, a game project and some excercise sheets. The code in this portfolio is written by myself. The game project code is therefore only an excerpt of the whole source code for the game.For more details please refer to the portfolio pdf that can be find in this folder.

The Python code is from my Bachelor Thesis about Individualizing a Spatial Reasoner for the Mental Model Theory.
For this thesis is used the CCOBRA Framework with which mental models can be tested and compared. All Python code
is Pylint conform.

The C# code is from the game project. It is a 2D game with pirate ships that has a similar gameplay as an RTS.
The game was created with Monogame. My part of the development was the ship control, like movement, attacks etc. and the control of the enemy ships. 

The Java code contains the code from two exercise sheets from a Information Retrieval class. Sheet 2 is implementing an inverted index to enable a quick search in a big amount of data. Sheet 7 is a further advanced implementation of this inverted index integrated in a Java server and a simple frontend for a simple search functionality like with google.
